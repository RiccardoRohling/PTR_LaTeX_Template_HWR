\chapter{Statement of Academic Integrity}

% The main text of the declaration.
I solemnly declare that I have independently completed the present work in all its parts and
have not used any sources or aids other than those specified in the work. Furthermore, this
work has not been submitted in the same or similar form for any other examination. All
verbatim or paraphrased quotations, as well as all sections that were designed, drafted,
and/or edited with the help of AI-based tools, are clearly marked and documented. In the
appendix of my work, I have listed all AI-based tools used, along with product names and
formulated inputs (prompts) in an AI directory.

I am aware that the use of texts or other content and products generated by AI-based tools
does not guarantee their quality. I take full responsibility for any machine-generated
passages I have used and bear the responsibility for any potentially erroneous or distorted
content generated by the AI, incorrect references, violations of data protection and copyright
laws, or plagiarism.
