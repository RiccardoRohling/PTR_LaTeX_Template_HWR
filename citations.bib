  abstract = {This paper introduces design patterns for dashboards to inform dashboard design processes. Despite a growing number of public examples, case studies, and general guidelines there is surprisingly little design guidance for dashboards. Such guidance is necessary to inspire designs and discuss tradeoffs in, e.g., screenspace, interaction, or information shown. Based on a systematic review of 144 dashboards, we report on eight groups of design patterns that provide common solutions in dashboard design. We discuss combinations of these patterns in dashboard genres such as narrative, analytical, or embedded dashboard. We ran a 2-week dashboard design workshop with 23 participants of varying expertise working on their own data and dashboards. We discuss the application of patterns for the dashboard design processes, as well as general design tradeoffs and common challenges. Our work complements previous surveys and aims to support dashboard designers and researchers in co-creation, structured design decisions, as well as future user evaluations about dashboard design guidelines. Detailed pattern descriptions and workshop material can be found online: https://dashboarddesignpatterns.github.io},

  abstract = {Abstract             Several well-established research streams examine how incumbent firm behavior affects the entry decisions of later entrants, e.g., in terms of herding or differentiation. While it makes sense for a new entrant to take into account an incumbent’s behavior to inform its entry decisions, it would be risky to base such a decision solely on that information. In particular, the potential entrant may also want to conduct its own market research. Naturally, the market research should account for incumbent behavior. Yet, little is known about how a second mover decides where it should conduct market research. Is the information gained from observing the incumbent a substitute or a complement to market research? The information a second mover gathers through observation includes the incumbent’s choice of market. Even more important is the signal generated by an incumbent’s decision to exit or stay in a market. This decision signals to a second mover whether a market is viable, at least for one firm. A second mover that considers entry between an existing market (with an operating incumbent) and a new market (that has no incumbents) chooses between different types of uncertainty. Our paper addresses how this uncertainty affects the second mover’s market research decision. Should a second mover do market research in the competitor’s backyard or should it boldly go where no firm has gone before and research a new market? How is this decision affected by factors such as expected demand conditions and competition? Intuition suggests that information about a virgin market is always more valuable because the first mover already provides information about the existing market. Our research shows that this intuition is not always correct. It is correct when market research generates perfect information. However, market research is rarely perfect. When market research provides estimates subject to an error, a second mover may gain by conducting market research in a market with an existing competitor. Here, the complementarity of the competitor’s performance coupled with market research amplifies the value of the research.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Introduction               Significant advances in the treatment of transthyretin (ATTR) amyloidosis has led to an evolving understanding of the epidemiology of this condition. This systematic literature review (SLR) aims to synthesize current evidence on epidemiology and mortality outcomes in ATTR amyloidosis, addressing the need for a comprehensive understanding of its current global impact.                                         Methods               An SLR of the literature from January 2018 to April 2023 was conducted using the Medline and Embase databases. The review followed the PRISMA guidelines. Studies evaluating populations with genotypes and phenotypes of ATTR amyloidosis~(variant and wild-type cardiomyopathy, polyneuropathy, and mixed) were included. Observational studies, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses were eligible, while reports, commentaries, clinical trials, and non-ATTR amyloidosis studies were excluded. Extracted data included prevalence, incidence, and mortality rates.                                         Results                                Of the 1,458 studies identified, 113 met the inclusion criteria. Forty-nine studies reported on epidemiology, while 64 focused on mortality rates in cohorts of patients with ATTR amyloidosis from Europe (                 n                 \,=\,16), North America (                 n                 \,=\,26), Asia (                 n                 \,=\,5), and Australia (                 n                 \,=\,2). No studies were found that exclusively focused on ATTR amyloidosis in Africa or South America. ATTR prevalence ranged from 6.1/million in the US to 232/million in Portugal with very limited data on ATTR-PN. The 2-year mortality risk ranged from 10 to 30\% among wild-type ATTR-CM and from 10 to 50\% for variant type of ATTR-CM.                                                        Conclusions               This SLR demonstrated heterogeneity in ATTR epidemiology and mortality rates across global regions. Further investigation is needed to address knowledge gaps of the epidemiology and burden of ATTR, which may improve early diagnosis and management.},

  abstract = {Often considered a rare disease, cardiac amyloidosis is increasingly recognized by practicing clinicians. The increased rate of diagnosis is in part due the aging of the population and increasing incidence and prevalence of cardiac amyloidosis with advancing age, as well as the advent of noninvasive methods using nuclear scintigraphy to diagnose transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis due to either variant or wild type transthyretin without a biopsy. Perhaps the most important driver of the increased awareness is the elucidation of the biologic mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of cardiac amyloidosis which have led to the development of several effective therapies with differing mechanisms of actions. In this review, the mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of cardiac amyloidosis due to light chain (AL) or transthyretin (ATTR) amyloidosis are delineated as well as the rapidly evolving therapeutic landscape that has emerged from a better pathophysiologic understanding of disease development.},

As a result, 36 topics were discovered that reflect the field’s research landscape and trends. Topics such as “Organizational Capability”, “AI Applications”, “Data Mining”, “Big Data Analytics”, and “Visualization” have recently gained popularity. A systematic taxonomic map was also created, revealing the research background and BI perspectives based on the topics. This study may be useful to researchers and practitioners interested in learning about the most recent developments in the field. Topics generated by topic modeling can also be used to identify gaps in current research or potential future research directions.},

Web-based platforms such as the euPOLIS Visualization Platform (eVP) are also discussed, showcasing their ability to monitor the spatiotemporal impact of nature-based solutions in urban environments [2].The paper further investigates interactive and immersive visualization techniques, including three-dimensional representations and virtual/augmented reality applications, which offer heightened immersion and facilitate collaborative data exploration [3]. Domain-specific applications in healthcare, environmental monitoring, and business intelligence are analyzed to demonstrate the practical benefits of advanced visualization tools. The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) is identified as a key technological enabler, enhancing analytical capabilities and pattern recognition [4]. Blockchain and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies are also explored for their roles in ensuring transparency and enabling real-time data visualization in various sectors [5] , [6]. User-centered design approaches and evaluation methods are emphasized to ensure the effectiveness and usability of visualization systems. Finally, the review addresses existing limitations and challenges, proposing future research directions such as privacy-preserving visualization techniques and further integration of AI and ML to improve data analysis and communication.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR) is a rare disease that results in amyloid fibril misfolding and deposition in multiple organs, including the heart, leading to the development of ATTR cardiomyopathy (ATTR‐CM), which is associated with poor outcomes. In the last decade, several disease‐modifying medications are in advanced stages of clinical development or have been approved to treat ATTR‐CM. The purpose of this review is to critically evaluate clinical trial data investigating the use of approved and investigational medications for the treatment of ATTR‐CM. We performed a comprehensive literature search via PubMed and EMBASE to identify randomized controlled trials evaluating medications for the treatment of ATTR‐CM published through August 2024. This narrative review describes the pathophysiology of ATTR‐CM, highlights important screening and diagnostic work‐up, and summarizes the existing clinical evidence resulting from our literature search. Several classes of disease‐modifying medications are in development for ATTR‐CM. The tetramer stabilizers and transthyretin silencers have proven to be the most effective therapies to date. Tafamidis and acoramidis are currently approved for ATTR‐CM while vutrisiran approval for ATTR‐CM may be forthcoming. Other disease‐modifying medication classes in development include antisense oligonucleotides, gene editing therapies, and monoclonal antibodies. However, several unmet needs exist including the lack of cost‐effectiveness due to the extremely high acquisition costs of these medications. Disease‐modifying medications approved and in development to treat ATTR‐CM offer hope for patients with this disease, but their lack of affordability is the biggest barrier to their use.},

  abstract = {Background: In the phase 3 randomized controlled study, ATTRibute-CM, acoramidis, a transthyretin (TTR) stabilizer, demonstrated significant efficacy on the primary endpoint. Participants with transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM) who completed ATTRibute-CM were invited to enroll in an open-label extension study (OLE). We report efficacy and safety data of acoramidis in participants who completed ATTRibute-CM and enrolled in the ongoing OLE.             Methods: Participants who previously received acoramidis through Month 30 (M30) in ATTRibute-CM continued to receive it (continuous acoramidis), and those who received placebo through M30 were switched to acoramidis (placebo to acoramidis). Participants who received concomitant tafamidis in ATTRibute-CM were required to discontinue it to be eligible to enroll in the OLE. Clinical efficacy outcomes analyzed through Month 42 (M42) included time to event for all-cause mortality (ACM) or first cardiovascular-related hospitalization (CVH), ACM alone, first CVH alone, ACM or recurrent CVH, change from baseline in N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), 6-minute walk distance (6MWD), serum TTR, and the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire Overall Summary score (KCCQ-OS). Safety outcomes were analyzed through M42.                            Results: Overall, 438 of 632 participants in ATTRibute-CM completed treatment and 389 enrolled in the ongoing OLE (263 continuous acoramidis, 126 placebo to acoramidis). The hazard ratio (HR) (95\% CI) for ACM or first CVH was 0.57 (0.46, 0.72) at M42 based on a stratified Cox proportional hazards model (               P               -value {$<$} 0.0001) favoring continuous acoramidis. Similar analyses were performed on ACM alone and first CVH alone, with HRs (95\% CI) of 0.64 (0.47, 0.88) and 0.53 (0.41, 0.69), respectively, at M42. Treatment effects for NT-proBNP and 6MWD also favored continuous acoramidis. Upon initiation of open-label acoramidis in the placebo-to-acoramidis arm there was a prompt increase in serum TTR. Quality of life assessed by KCCQ-OS was well preserved in continuous acoramidis participants compared with the placebo to acoramidis participants. No new clinically important safety issues were identified in this long-term evaluation.                          Conclusions: Early initiation and continuous use of acoramidis in the ATTRibute-CM study through M42 of the ongoing OLE study was associated with sustained clinical benefits in a contemporary ATTR-CM cohort, with no clinically important safety issues newly identified.},

  abstract = {The pharmaceutical industry thus has many pieces of equipment that are very critical and very sensitive to breakdowns, and these are used in almost all the steps of production and are very crucial in ensuring that they meet the set regulatory requirements as well as achieve the best quality in production. Most of the maintenance undertakings are carried out following the ‘break and fix’ or ‘run and correct’ method, which results in poor performance, unanticipated machine failure, and high costs. The use of business intelligence tools such as Power BI is a revolution in the business fraternity as it enhances the ability to monitor data in real time, implement real-life maintenance, and result in the formulation of data-based decisions. General maintenance data from various sources, including mechanical or electrical equipment sensors, ERP systems, or maintenance logs, is integrated into Power BI platforms and provides detailed insights into KPIs that cover operational readability and failure anticipation and schedules for the maintenance department. With the help of Power BI and its sophisticated capabilities for data analysis and artificial intelligence, the pharmaceutical industry can easily change from a periodical maintenance regimen to a prescriptive and predictive one – thus improving machinery performance and reducing the chances of overall production failures. The framework suggested in this research leverages Power BI’s functionality to enhance the management of maintenance through the consolidation of various data sets and storage of the data in a single location. The infrastructure allows the real-time monitoring of equipment health status reporting and improves or even provides decision-making with the use of trend analysis and analytics. By using Power BI, maintenance teams in the pharmaceutical industry are able to determine failure trends and usage frequency of the pieces of equipment. Consequently, they are able to determine where to channel their efforts and minimize costs. Findings shown in the case of this study, therefore, show a considerable improvement in equipment availability or use and costs of maintenance, affirming the benefits that could be obtained from the BI-driven approach. Also, due to the specific focus on the field of pharmaceuticals, the impact of Power BI in compliance reporting and audit purposes of maintenance operations is investigated. Thus, through the implementation of this technology, pharmaceutical organizations will be able to optimize their performance and even gain a competitive advantage of running uninterrupted, high-quality production lines},

Recent Findings               Once thought to be a rare and fatal condition, increased recognition, improved non-invasive diagnostic tools, and the explosive development of novel therapies, has transformed the landscape of transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM). Advances in cardiac imaging with respect to echocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR), and radionuclide bone scintigraphy has increased the diagnosis of ATTR-CM over the last twenty years. Ongoing clinical trials are evaluating several novel therapies at several mechanistic targets in the transthyretin (TTR) amyloidogenesis cascade, including the recently published findings from the study of vutrisiran, a siRNA agent.                                         Summary               Our review provides a comprehensive summary of current and emerging therapies for ATTR-CM. While these are promising, disease-modifying treatments, reaching vulnerable populations early in the disease course should be a focus for future studies and interventions.},

  abstract = {The misassembly of soluble proteins into toxic aggregates, including amyloid fibrils, underlies a large number of human degenerative diseases. Cardiac amyloidoses, which are most commonly caused by aggregation of Ig light chains or transthyretin (TTR) in the cardiac interstitium and conducting system, represent an important and often underdiagnosed cause of heart failure. Two types of TTR-associated amyloid cardiomyopathies are clinically important. The Val122Ile (V122I) mutation, which alters the kinetic stability of TTR and affects 3\% to 4\% of African American subjects, can lead to development of familial amyloid cardiomyopathy. In addition, aggregation of WT TTR in individuals older than age 65 y causes senile systemic amyloidosis. TTR-mediated amyloid cardiomyopathies are chronic and progressive conditions that lead to arrhythmias, biventricular heart failure, and death. As no Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs are currently available for treatment of these diseases, the development of therapeutic agents that prevent TTR-mediated cardiotoxicity is desired. Here, we report the development of AG10, a potent and selective kinetic stabilizer of TTR. AG10 prevents dissociation of V122I-TTR in serum samples obtained from patients with familial amyloid cardiomyopathy. In contrast to other TTR stabilizers currently in clinical trials, AG10 stabilizes V122I- and WT-TTR equally well and also exceeds their efficacy to stabilize WT and mutant TTR in whole serum. Crystallographic studies of AG10 bound to V122I-TTR give valuable insights into how AG10 achieves such effective kinetic stabilization of TTR, which will also aid in designing better TTR stabilizers. The oral bioavailability of AG10, combined with additional desirable drug-like features, makes it a very promising candidate to treat TTR amyloid cardiomyopathy.},

Slicers provide interactive controls that allow users to easily filter data based on criteria such as department, location, or job title. Set up a mechanism to update data automatically or manually to ensure the dashboard reflects the latest HR information. Test the dashboard functionality and usability thoroughly. Gather feedback from stakeholders to refine and improve the dashboard based on their needs and preferences.},
